# DeepClusterADMM
This repository is provided to reproduce the results of our paper "DeepCluster: A General Clustering Framework based on Deep Learning".
All those softwares are implemented in MATLAB.

## Quick Start
To let you start the code quickly, we incorprated the pretrained weights of DAE.

Startup your MATLAB, and simply run 
```
demo
```
to see the basic performance of DeepCluster.

To dive into the implementation of DeepCluster. See
```
run_dkmeans.m
run_dgmm_full.m
```

## Make it better
If you have better implementations or better hyper-parameter settings, please pull your requests. 

## Notes
As there exists random initialization of clustering methods, so it is normal to have permissible error compared to the results as reported in the paper.
